This lab focuses on monitoring and modeling cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Atitlán and Lake Amatitlán, Guatemala. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, custom spectral indices, and geospatial analysis, we detect bloom patterns, perform temporal and spatial studies, and develop predictive models to assess and forecast water quality conditions.
